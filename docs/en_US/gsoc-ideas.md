# GSoC 2024 Ideas List

Hi there! This is the ideas list of OceanBase for Google Summer of Code 2024! 

As a first-year mentor organization, we focus the development ideas on ob-operator, a kubernetes operator which helps deploy and manage OceanBase cluster on kubernetes cluster seamlessly. There are five projects for contributors, and we'll offer dedicated guidance for every choice.

Enjoy your summer of code!

## 1. CLI tool

* Project Description: The primary method to manage CRDs of ob-operator currently is manipulating YAML manifests which is not easy enough for new-coming users to get started. We'd like to provide features such as component installation, demo setup and resource management within a CLI tool.
* Required Skills: Golang, Kubernetes
* Project Size: intermediate, about 175 hours
* Possible mentors: He Wang, Arthur
* Expected Outcomes: A complete CLI tool that helps to install necessary components, set up demo clusters and manage creation, update and deletion of CRDs such as clusters, tenants and backups.

## 2. Light-weighted Operations

* Project Description: Use Light-weighted operation task types to influence the configuration of resources instead of modifying specifications of those bigger resources directly.
* Required Skills: Golang, Development of Kubernetes controller, Docker
* Project Size: intermediate, about 175 hours
* Possible mentors: Jing Ding, Chris Sun
* Expected Outcomes: Implementation of CRD(s) and corresponding controller(s) for clusters, tenants and backups, which can trigger small operational actions and reveal the progress through their own status.

## 3. Alertmanager Integration

* Project Description: There are some features about cluster management in OceanBase dashboard, a web-based dashboard application. OceanBase dashboard has bundled prometheus to manage time series metrics data by now. However it lacks of alerting features like high resource utilization alerts. So integrating alertmanager into OceanBase dashboard could be an attracive feature.
* Required Skills: Web development(React), Kubernetes, Prometheus, Alertmanager
* Project Size: intermediate, about 175 hours
* Possible mentors: Rongfeng Fu, Arthur
* Expected Outcomes: An independent functional panel in OceanBase dashboard in which users could view alert events, configure alert rules, and define alert templates in the scope of alertmanager.

## 4. ODP Management in OceanBase Dashboard

* Project Description: OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP), also called OBProxy, is a dedicated proxy server for OceanBase Database. Core features of ODP include connection management, optimal routing, high-performance forwarding, easy O&M, high availability, and proprietary protocol. ODP should be integrated into OceanBase dashboard to enhance proxy management.
* Required Skills: Web development(React), Golang Kubernetes,
* Project Size: intermediate, about 175 hours
* Possible mentors: Quanqing Xu, Rongfeng Fu
* Expected Outcomes: A independent functional panel (the same level as cluster management) in OceanBase dashboard where users could set up, configure and even delete ODP for specific OceanBase clusters.

## 5. Accounts management and RBAC admission control

* Project Description: OceanBase Dashboard is a web-based management platform for ob-operator, with support for managing cluster and tenant clearly. Currently, it has a quite simple account system that stores and retrieves user credentials with `Secret` resource. And, it lacks any form of admission control. So it would be a good starting point to develop an account management module, complemented by a robust RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) permissions system.
* Required Skills: Golang, Kubernetes
* Project Size: intermediate, about 175 hours
* Possible mentors: Jing Ding, Chris Sun
* Expected Outcomes: an advanced account management module paired with an RBAC-aligned permissions system.
