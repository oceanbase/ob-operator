                          by a cluster storage driver. The volume's lifecycle is tied
                          to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the
                          pod starts, and deleted when the pod is removed. \n Use
                          this if: a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                          b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot
                          or capacity tracking are needed, c) the storage driver is
                          specified through a storage class, and d) the storage driver
                          supports dynamic volume provisioning through a PersistentVolumeClaim
                          (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more information on the connection
                          between this volume type and PersistentVolumeClaim). \n
                          Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                          APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                          of an individual pod. \n Use CSI for light-weight local
                          ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to be used
                          that way - see the documentation of the driver for more
                          information. \n A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes
                          and persistent volumes at the same time."

                                      are three important differences between dataSource
                                      and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource only allows

                                      allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                      objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed
                                      values (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves
                                      all values, and generates an error if a disallowed
                                      value is specified. * While dataSource only
                                      allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                      in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this field requires

                                      set to the same value and must be empty. There
                                      are three important differences between dataSource
                                      and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource only allows
                                      two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                      allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                      objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed
                                      values (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves
                                      all values, and generates an error if a disallowed
                                      value is specified. * While dataSource only
                                      allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                      in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this field requires
                                      the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                      requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource
                                      feature gate to be enabled.'

                                      allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                      objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed
                                      values (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves
                                      all values, and generates an error if a disallowed
                                      value is specified. * While dataSource only
                                      allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                      in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this field requires
