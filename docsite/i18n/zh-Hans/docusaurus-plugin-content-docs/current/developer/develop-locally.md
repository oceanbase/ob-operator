# Develop ob-operator locally

## Introduction

ob-operator depends on [kubebuilder](https://kubebuilder.io/introduction), an operator framework maintained by kubernetes SIGS. It offers convenient utilities to bootstrap an operator and manage API types in it. Like other operator frameworks, kubebuilder depends on kubernetes [controller runtime](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime) either, which is an excellent reference to know how kubernetes dispatch events and reconcile resources.

## Requirements

- Go 1.22 or above is required to build ob-operator, you can refer to the [official website](https://go.dev/) to setup go environment.
- [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) is used for a variety of build and test actions.
- kubebuilder is used as k8s operator framework. it's highly recommended to read [kubebuilder books](https://book.kubebuilder.io/). 
- Access to a kubernetes cluster is required to develop and test the operator. You can use [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/), [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/) or [k3s](https://k3s.io/) to create a local kubernetes cluster.

## Modify and Apply CRDs

### Modify definition of CRDs

`ob-operator` uses kubebuilder as operator framework, which generates CRDs in YAML format from Go code lies in `api/v1alpha1` directory. If you have modified the Go code, for example adding a new field to `OBClusterSpec` in `api/v1alpha1/obcluster_types.go`, you need to regenerate the CRDs by running `make generate manifests fmt`. Then you will see changes in `config/crd/bases/oceanbase.oceanbase.com_xxx.yaml` files.

### Apply the Changes

You can apply the changes of CRDs to kubernetes cluster by running `make install`. This command will apply the CRDs to the kubernetes cluster.

You will see output like the following after executing `kubectl get crds` command if the CRDs are successfully applied:

```shell
$ kubectl get crds | grep oceanbase.oceanbase.com
obclusters.oceanbase.oceanbase.com               2024-01-01T00:00:00Z

```

## Modify and Run ob-operator

ob-operator acts as a controller manager, which watches the resources in kubernetes cluster and reconciles them. The controller manager is generated by kubebuilder, and the main logic lies in `internal/{controller,resource}` and `pkg/coordinator` directories.

### Build and Deploy

After modifying the code, you can build the docker image by running `make docker-build docker-push IMG=<your-image-name>`. Then you can deploy the controller manager to the kubernetes cluster by running `make deploy IMG=<your-image-name>`.

If the docker need root permission to build, you can run building command with `sudo`, like

```bash
sudo make docker-build IMG=<your-image-name>
make docker-push IMG=<your-image-name> # If you need to push the image to a registry
make deploy IMG=<your-image-name>
```

:::tip
If the developing machine and the deploying machine is the same one, you can skip the pushing step `make docker-push`.
:::

### Run locally

Building docker image and pushing it to a registry is time-consuming, especially when you are developing and debugging. You can run controller manager locally to accelerate the development process.

:::tip
In this step, we'll disable webhook validation and run controller manager on the developing machine. The controller manager will communicate with kubernetes cluster by local .kube/config configuration file.
:::

#### Disable Webhook and CertManager

There are many configuration items that marked by `[CERTMANAGER]` and `[WEBHOOK]` in the two files `config/crd/kustomization.yaml` and `config/default/kustomization.yaml`. They are used to enable and configure webhooks in real kubernetes deployment. Because we want to run controller manager locally, we need to disable them.

You could just apply the latest `deploy/operator.yaml` manifest and delete the following resources to deploy CRDs and make controller manager uninstalled.

```shell
kubectl delete validatingwebhookconfigurations.admissionregistration.k8s.io oceanbase-validating-webhook-configuration
kubectl delete mutatingwebhookconfigurations.admissionregistration.k8s.io oceanbase-mutating-webhook-configuration
kubectl delete -n oceanbase-system svc oceanbase-webhook-service
kubectl delete -n oceanbase-system deployments.apps oceanbase-controller-manager
```

#### Generate Self-signed Certificates

It's necessary for node hosting controller manager to have a TLS certificate. In the real kubernetes cluster, the cert-manager will inject the sign into the controller manager pod. On our laptop, we need self-sign one:

```shell
mkdir -p /tmp/k8s-webhook-server/serving-certs
openssl genrsa -out /tmp/k8s-webhook-server/serving-certs/tls.key 2048
openssl req -new -key /tmp/k8s-webhook-server/serving-certs/tls.key -out /tmp/k8s-webhook-server/serving-certs/tls.csr
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in /tmp/k8s-webhook-server/serving-certs/tls.csr -signkey /tmp/k8s-webhook-server/serving-certs/tls.key -out /tmp/k8s-webhook-server/serving-certs/tls.crt
```

#### Run ob-operator on Your Machine

There are some useful commands in `Makefile` and `make/*.mk`, we could type `make run-local` to start controller manager locally. Or redirect the output to a log file for better analytic experience,

```shell
# print log to stdout
make run-local
# or redirect output to a file
make run-local &> bin/run.log
```

### Debugging

Though print debugging is enough for most cases, there are quite some cases that are not obvious from printed information. We could debug with go debugging tool [delve](https://github.com/go-delve/delve).

`install-delve` command is declared in `make/debug.mk`, you can type `make install-delve` to get it. The help message of it can be glanced,

```shell dlv help
Delve is a source level debugger for Go programs.

Delve enables you to interact with your program by controlling the execution of the process,
evaluating variables, and providing information of thread / goroutine state, CPU register state and more.

The goal of this tool is to provide a simple yet powerful interface for debugging Go programs.

Pass flags to the program you are debugging using `--`, for example:

`dlv exec ./hello -- server --config conf/config.toml`

Usage:
  dlv [command]

Available Commands:
  attach      Attach to running process and begin debugging.
  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  connect     Connect to a headless debug server with a terminal client.
  core        Examine a core dump.
  dap         Starts a headless TCP server communicating via Debug Adaptor Protocol (DAP).
  debug       Compile and begin debugging main package in current directory, or the package specified.
  exec        Execute a precompiled binary, and begin a debug session.
  help        Help about any command
  test        Compile test binary and begin debugging program.
  trace       Compile and begin tracing program.
  version     Prints version.

Additional help topics:
  dlv backend    Help about the --backend flag.
  dlv log        Help about logging flags.
  dlv redirect   Help about file redirection.
```

#### Debug in VSCode

If you are first to debugging in VSCode, enter `Cmd+Shift+P` to open commands panel. Then, type `Debug: Add Configuration...` and create debugging task for Go. After creating task successfully, open commands panel and type `Debug: Start Debugging`/`Debug: Select and Start Debugging` to start debugging.
