# FAQ

## 1. How do I make sure that a resource is ready?

Assume that you want to view the resource status of a cluster. Run the following command:

```shell
kubectl get obclusters.oceanbase.oceanbase.com test -n oceanbase
```

If the status is `running` in the response, the resource is ready.

```shell
# desired output
NAME   STATUS    AGE
test   running   6m2s
```

## 2. How do I view the O&M status of a resource?

Assume that you want to view the resource status of a cluster. Run the following command:

```shell
kubectl get obclusters.oceanbase.oceanbase.com test -n oceanbase -o yaml
```

You can check the status and progress of O&M tasks based on values of parameters in the `operationContext` section in the response.

```shell
status:
  image: oceanbase/oceanbase-cloud-native:4.2.0.0-101000032023091319
  obzones:
  - status: delete observer
    zone: obcluster-1-zone1
  - status: delete observer
    zone: obcluster-1-zone2
  - status: delete observer
    zone: obcluster-1-zone3
  operationContext:
    failureRule:
      failureStatus: running
      failureStrategy: retry over
      retryCount: 0
    idx: 2
    name: modify obzone replica
    targetStatus: running
    task: wait obzone topology match
    taskId: c04aeb28-01e7-4f85-b390-8d855b9f30e3
    taskStatus: running
    tasks:
    - modify obzone replica
    - wait obzone topology match
    - wait obzone running
  parameters: []
  status: modify obzone replica
```

## 3. How do I do troubleshooting for ob-operator and OceanBase?

* Generally, you need to first analyze the logs of ob-operator to locate an error. Run the following command to view the logs of ob-operator:

```shell
kubectl logs oceanbase-controller-manager-86cfc8f7bf-js95z -n oceanbase-system -c manager  | less
```

* View the logs of the OBServer node

```shell
# Log on to the container of the OBServer node.
kubectl exec -it obcluster-1-zone1-8ab645f4d0f9 -n oceanbase -c observer -- bash

# The directory where the log files are located.
cd /home/admin/oceanbase/log
```

## 4. How do I fix a "stuck" resource in ob-operator?

:::tip
`OBResourceRescue` is a feature that is **only available in ob-operator 2.2.0 and later**. You can fix a "stuck" resource through patching the resource with K8s API before 2.2.0. Refer to [kubectl patch](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/generated/kubectl_patch/) for more information.
:::

As ob-operator uses a state machine and task flow to manage custom resources (CRs) and their O&M operations, there may be situations where CRs are in an unexpected state. This could include continuously retrying a task flow that is bound to fail, failing to delete a resource, or mistakenly deleting a resource that needs to be recovered. In cases where a CR cannot be restored to normal through regular operations, you can use the `OBResourceRescue` resource to rescue the problematic CR. The `OBResourceRescue` resource includes four types of operations: `reset`, `delete`, `retry`, and `skip`.

A typical `OBResourceRescue` CR configuration is as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: oceanbase.oceanbase.com/v1alpha1
kind: OBResourceRescue
metadata:
  generateName: rescue-reset- # generateName needs to be used with kubectl create -f
spec:
  type: reset
  targetKind: OBCluster
  targetResName: test
  targetStatus: running # The target status needs to be filled in when the type is reset
```

The key configurations are explained in the following table:

| Configuration item | Optional values | Description |
| -- | -- | -- |
| type | `reset`, `delete`, `retry`, `skip` | The type of the resource rescue action |
| targetKind | `OBCluster`, `OBZone`, `OBTenant`, and other CRD kind managed by ob-operator | The kind of the resource to be rescued |
| targetResName | / | The name of the resource to be rescued |
| targetStatus | / | This field needs to be filled in when the type is reset, indicating the status of the resource after the reset |


### Reset

The configuration example of the typical CR above is a reset type of resource rescue. After creating this resource in the K8s cluster using the `kubectl create -f` command, ob-operator sets the `status.status` of the resource whose kind is `OBCluster` and name is `test` to `running` (the `targetStatus` set in the configuration file), and sets the `status.operationContext` of the resource to empty.

### Delete

The configuration example of the delete type of rescue action is as follows. After creating this resource in the cluster, ob-operator clears the `finalizers` field of the target resource and sets the `deletionTimestamp` of the resource to the current time.

```yaml
# ...
spec:
  type: delete
  targetKind: OBCluster
  targetResName: test
```

### Retry

The configuration example of the retry type of rescue action is as follows. After creating this resource in the cluster, ob-operator sets the `status.operationContext.retryCount` of the target resource to 0 and sets the `status.operationContext.taskStatus` to `pending`. Resources in this state will retry the current task.

```yaml
# ...
spec:
  type: retry
  targetKind: OBCluster
  targetResName: test
```

### Skip

The configuration example of the skip type of rescue action is as follows. After creating this resource in the cluster, ob-operator directly sets the `status.operationContext.taskStatus` of the target resource to `successful`. After receiving this message, the task manager will execute the next task in the `tasks` field.

```yaml
# ...
spec:
  type: skip
  targetKind: OBCluster
  targetResName: test
```
