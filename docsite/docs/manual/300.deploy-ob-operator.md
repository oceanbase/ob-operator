# Deploy

This topic describes how to deploy ob-operator.

## Prerequisites

ob-operator depends on cert-manager. Before you deploy ob-operator, make sure that you have installed cert-manager. For more information about how to install cert-manager, see the [installation document](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/).

## Use Helm to deploy ob-operator

You can deploy ob-operator by using Helm. For more information about how to install Helm, see the documentation on [GitHub](https://github.com/helm/helm). After you install Helm, run the following command to deploy ob-operator:

```shell
helm repo add ob-operator https://oceanbase.github.io/ob-operator/
helm install ob-operator ob-operator/ob-operator --namespace=oceanbase-system --create-namespace --version=2.1.0
```

The parameters are described as follows:

* namespace: the namespace for ob-operator. You can specify a custom namespace as needed. We recommend that you use `oceanbase-system`.

* version: the version of ob-operator. We recommend that you use the latest version.

## Use configuration files to deploy ob-operator

You can deploy ob-operator by using the configuration file for the stable or developing version of ob-operator as needed.

* Deploy the stable version of ob-operator

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oceanbase/ob-operator/2.2.1_release/deploy/operator.yaml
   ```

* Deploy the developing version of ob-operator

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oceanbase/ob-operator/master/deploy/operator.yaml
   ```

We recommend that you use the configuration file for the stable version of ob-operator.

## View the deployment result

After the deployment is completed, you can run the following command to view the custom resource definitions (CRDs):

```shell
kubectl get crds
```

If the output is similar to the following example, the CRDs are deployed:

```shell
NAME                                            CREATED AT
obparameters.oceanbase.oceanbase.com             2023-11-12T08:06:58Z

obtenantbackuppolicies.oceanbase.oceanbase.com   2023-11-12T08:06:58Z
```

Run the following command to check whether ob-operator is deployed:

```shell
kubectl get pods -n oceanbase-system
```

The following result is returned. If all the containers are ready and in the running state, ob-operator is deployed.

```shell
NAME                                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
oceanbase-controller-manager-86cfc8f7bf-4hfnj   2/2     Running   0          1m
```
