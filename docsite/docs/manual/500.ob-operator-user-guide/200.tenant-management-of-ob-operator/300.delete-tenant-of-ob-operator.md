# Delete a tenant

This topic describes how to use ob-operator to delete a tenant from a Kubernetes environment.

## Procedure

You can delete the specified tenant resources from the cluster by using the configuration file `tenant.yaml`. For more information about the configuration file, visit [GitHub](https://github.com/oceanbase/ob-operator/blob/2.2.2_release/example/tenant/tenant.yaml).

Run the following command to delete a tenant. This command deletes an OceanBase Database tenant with custom resources in the current Kubernetes cluster.

```shell
kubectl delete -f tenant.yaml
```

Run the following command to check whether the current Kubernetes cluster contains the custom resources of the deleted tenant:

```shell
kubectl get obtenants.oceanbase.oceanbase.com -A -o yaml
```

If not, the tenant is deleted.
