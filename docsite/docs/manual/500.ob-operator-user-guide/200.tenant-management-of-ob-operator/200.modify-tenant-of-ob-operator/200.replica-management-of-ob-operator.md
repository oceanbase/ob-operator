# Manage replicas

This topic describes how to manage tenant replicas by using ob-operator.

## Modify the primary zone of a tenant

You can modify the `priority` parameter of zones in the tenant configuration file to modify the primary zone of a tenant. A larger number indicates a higher priority. The minimum value is `1`.

The primary zone describes the preferred location of the leader. The leader handles strong-consistency read traffic and write traffic of the business. Therefore, the primary zone determines the traffic distribution of OceanBase Database. You can modify the primary zone to switch business traffic from one IDC to another or from one city to another in disaster recovery and scaling scenarios.

### Procedure

1. Modify the tenant configuration file `tenant.yaml` to adjust the priority value for each zone.

   ```yaml
   - zone: zone1
     priority: 1
   - zone: zone2
     priority: 1
   - zone: zone3
     priority: 3

   # After modification
   - zone: zone1
     priority: 3
   - zone: zone2
     @priority 2
   - zone: zone3
     priority: 1
   ```

   The preceding configuration changes the primary zone of the tenant from `zone3;zone1,zone2` to `zone1;zone2;zone3`.

2. Run the following command for the modification to take effect:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f tenant.yaml
   ```

3. Run the following command to view the custom resources of the tenant in the current Kubernetes cluster to check whether the modification is successful:

   ```shell
   kubectl get obtenants.oceanbase.oceanbase.com -n oceanbase -o yaml
   ```

   If the value of the corresponding parameter in the `status.resourcePool.priority` section in the custom resources of the tenant is changed to the new value, the modification is successful.

   ```yaml
   status:
     ...
     resourcePool:
       - zone: zone1
         priority: 3
       - zone: zone2
         @priority 2
       - zone: zone3
         priority: 1
   ```

   You can also run the following command to view the result.

   ```shell
   kubectl get obtenants.oceanbase.oceanbase.com -n oceanbase -o wide
   ```

   The command output is as follows:

   ```shell
   NAME   STATUS    TENANTNAME   TENANTROLE   CLUSTERNAME   AGE   LOCALITY   PRIMARYZONE           POOLLIST    CHARSET
   t1     running   t1           PRIMARY      obcluster     13m   ...        zone1;zone2;zone3     ...         utf8mb4
   ```

   The result shows that the value of the `PRIMARYZONE` field is modified to `zone1;zone2;zone3`, which matches the priority configuration.

## Modify the locality of a tenant

To modify the locality of a tenant, you can modify the parameters in the `type` section to specify the replica type and the number of replicas. The following replica types are supported: `full`, `logonly`, and `readonly`.

For more information, see [Modify the primary zone of a tenant](# Modify the primary zone of a tenant).

Modify the tenant configuration file `tenant.yaml`:

```yaml
 type:
    name: Full # The Full and Readonly replica types are supported.
    replica: 1
```

## Add replicas

### Prerequisites

* You have added a zone to the cluster. For more information, see [Add zones to a cluster](../../100.cluster-management-of-ob-operator/300.zone-management/100.add-zone.md).

### Procedure

You can add zones to a tenant by modifying the tenant configuration file `tenant.yaml`.

Assume that the current cluster has four zones, `zone1`, `zone2`, `zone3`, and `zone4`, the zones corresponding to the tenant are `zone1`, `zone2`, and `zone3`, and you want to scale out the tenant to four zones.

1. Modify the configuration file `tenant.yaml` to add `zone4`.

   ```yaml
   # For example, the tenant has three zones.
   pools:
     - zone: zone1
       unitNum: 1
       type:
         name: Full
         replica: 1
       priority: 3
       resource:
         ...
     - zone: zone2
       unitNum: 1
       type:
         name: Full
         replica: 1
       priority: 3
       resource:
         ...
     - zone: zone3
       unitNum: 1
       type:
         name: Full
         replica: 1
       priority: 3
       resource:
         ...

   # Add zone4 to the tenant.
   pools:
     - zone: zone1
       unitNum: 1
       type:
         name: Full
         replica: 1
       priority: 3
       resource:
         ...
     - zone: zone2
       unitNum: 1
       type:
         name: Full
         replica: 1
       priority: 3
       resource:
         ...
     - zone: zone3
       unitNum: 1
       type:
         name: Full
         replica: 1
       priority: 3
       resource:
         ...
     - zone: zone4
       unitNum: 1
       type:
         name: Full
         replica: 1
       priority: 3
       resource:
         ...
   ```

2. Run the following command for the modification to take effect:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f tenant.yaml
   ```

3. Run the following command to view the custom resources of the tenant in the current Kubernetes cluster:

   ```shell
   kubectl get obtenants.oceanbase.oceanbase.com -n oceanbase -o wide
   ```

   The following command output shows that the value of the LOCALITY field is as expected:

   ```shell
   NAME   STATUS    TENANTNAME   TENANTROLE   CLUSTERNAME   AGE   LOCALITY                                                       PRIMARYZONE           POOLLIST    CHARSET
   t1     running   t1           PRIMARY      obcluster     19m   FULL{1}@zone1,FULL{1}@zone2,FULL{1}@zone3,FULL{1}@zone4        ...                   ...         utf8mb4
   ```

## Delete replicas

### Procedure

You can modify the tenant configuration file `tenant.yaml` to delete zones from a tenant.

Assume that the current cluster has four zones, `zone1`, `zone2`, `zone3`, and `zone4`, the zones corresponding to the tenant are `zone1`, `zone2`, `zone3`, and `zone4`, and you want to scale in the tenant to `zone1`, `zone2`, and `zone3`.

1. Modify the configuration file `tenant.yaml` to delete `zone4`.

   ```yaml
   # For example, the tenant has four zones.
   pools:
     - zone: zone1
       unitNum: 1
       type:
         name: Full
         replica: 1
       priority: 3
       resource:
         ...
     - zone: zone2
       unitNum: 1
       type:
         name: Full
         replica: 1
       priority: 3
       resource:
         ...
     - zone: zone3
       unitNum: 1
       type:
         name: Full
         replica: 1
       priority: 3
       resource:
         ...
     - zone: zone4
       unitNum: 1
       type:
         name: Full
         replica: 1
       priority: 3
       resource:
         ...

   # Delete zone4 from the tenant.
   pools:
     - zone: zone1
       unitNum: 1
       type:
         name: Full
         replica: 1
       priority: 3
       resource:
         ...
     - zone: zone2
       unitNum: 1
       type:
         name: Full
         replica: 1
       priority: 3
       resource:
         ...
     - zone: zone3
       unitNum: 1
       type:
         name: Full
         replica: 1
       priority: 3
       resource:
         ...
   ```

2. Run the following command for the modification to take effect:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f tenant.yaml
   ```

3. Run the following command to view the custom resources of the tenant in the current Kubernetes cluster:

   ```shell
   kubectl get obtenants.oceanbase.oceanbase.com -n oceanbase -o wide
   ```

   The following command output shows that the value of the LOCALITY field is as expected:

   ```shell
   NAME   STATUS    TENANTNAME   TENANTROLE   CLUSTERNAME   AGE   LOCALITY                                     PRIMARYZONE     POOLLIST    CHARSET
   t1     running   t1           PRIMARY      obcluster     25m   FULL{1}@zone1,FULL{1}@zone2,FULL{1}@zone3    ...             ...         utf8mb4
   ```
