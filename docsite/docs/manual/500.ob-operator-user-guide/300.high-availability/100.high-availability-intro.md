# High availability

ob-operator ensures the high availability of data by using the following features of OceanBase Database.

* Node fault recovery. The distributed architecture of OceanBase Database allows you to restore the service when a minority of nodes fail. By relying on certain network plugins, you can even restore the service from majority nodes failure. For more information, see [Restore service from faults](300.disaster-recovery-of-ob-operator.mdx).
* Backup and restore of tenant data. The backup and restore feature of OceanBase Database allows you to back up tenant data to different storage media to ensure data safety. For more information, see [Back up a tenant](400.tenant-backup-of-ob-operator.md).
* Primary and standby tenants. OceanBase Database allows you to create a standby tenant for the primary tenant. When a fault occurs to the primary tenant, you can quickly switch your business to the standby tenant to reduce the business interruption. For more information, see [Physical standby database](600.standby-tenant-of-ob-operator.md).
