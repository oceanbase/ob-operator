# Delete OBServer nodes from zones

This topic describes how to scale in a cluster by removing OBServer nodes from zones in the cluster.

## Prerequisites

* The OceanBase cluster is in the `Running` state.
* After the OBServer nodes are deleted, the cluster has sufficient resources for the units of tenants.

## Procedure

Assume that the current cluster has three zones, `zone1`, `zone2`, and `zone3`, each zone contains two OBServer nodes, and you want to delete one OBServer node from each zone so that each zone contains one OBServer node.

1. Open the `obcluster.yaml` configuration file and change the value of the `replica` parameter of each zone from `2` to `1`.

   ```yaml
   # For example, assume that an OceanBase cluster has three zones.
   topology:
     - zone: zone1
       replica: 2
     - zone: zone2
       replica: 2
     - zone: zone3
       replica: 2

   # Delete an OBServer node from each zone.
   topology:
     - zone: zone1
       replica: 1
     - zone: zone2
       replica: 1
     - zone: zone3
       replica: 1  
   ```

2. Run the following command for the modification to take effect:

   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f obcluster.yaml
   ```

3. Query the status of custom resources in the OceanBase cluster to check whether the operation succeeds.
   Run the following command to query the status of the OceanBase cluster.

```shell
kubectl get obclusters.oceanbase.oceanbase.com test -n oceanbase -o yaml

# obcluster desired output, only displays status here
status:
  image: oceanbase/oceanbase-cloud-native:4.2.0.0-101000032023091319
  obzones:
  - status: running
    zone: obcluster-1-zone1
  - status: running
    zone: obcluster-1-zone2
  - status: running
    zone: obcluster-1-zone3
  parameters: []
  status: running
```

Run the following command to check whether the number of OBServer nodes is correct and whether they are all in the `Running` state:

```
kubectl get observers.oceanbase.oceanbase.com -n oceanbase

# observer desired output, only displays status here
oceanbase     obcluster-1-zone1-7b0e9f7e7675   10.42.0.241   running   7h48m
oceanbase     obcluster-1-zone2-67f3d1fe0b40   10.42.0.251   running   28m
oceanbase     obcluster-1-zone3-914ef208ac46   10.42.0.252   running   28m
```
