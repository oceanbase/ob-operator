# Add zones to a cluster

This topic describes how to add zones to a cluster.

## Prerequisites

Before you add a zone to a cluster, make sure that the following conditions are met:

* The server must have sufficient resources for the new zone.
* The OceanBase cluster is in the `Running` state.

## Procedure

Assume that the current cluster has three zones, `zone1`, `zone2`, and `zone3`, and each zone contains one OBServer node. You can perform the following steps to scale out the cluster to one that consists of five zones.

1. Modify the `spec.topology` parameter in the `obcluster.yaml` configuration file to add `zone4` and `zone5`. For more information about the complete configuration file, see [Create a cluster](../200.create-cluster.md).

   ```yaml
   # For example, assume that an OceanBase cluster has three zones.
   topology:
       - zone: zone1
       replica: 1
       - zone: zone2
       replica: 1
       - zone: zone3
       replica: 1

   # Add zone4 and zone5 to the cluster.
   topology:
       - zone: zone1
       replica: 1
       - zone: zone2
       replica: 1
       - zone: zone3
       replica: 1
       - zone: zone4
       replica: 1
       - zone: zone5
       replica: 1
   ```

2. Run the following command for the modification to take effect:

   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f obcluster.yaml
   ```

3. Query the status of custom resources in the OceanBase cluster to check whether the operation succeeds.

Run the following command to query the status of custom resources in the OceanBase cluster. If the cluster and the five zones are in the `Running` state, the operation is successful.

```shell
kubectl get obclusters.oceanbase.oceanbase.com test -n oceanbase -o yaml

# desired output, only displays status here
status:
  image: oceanbase/oceanbase-cloud-native:4.2.0.0-101000032023091319
  obzones:
  - status: running
    zone: obcluster-1-zone1
  - status: running
    zone: obcluster-1-zone2
  - status: running
    zone: obcluster-1-zone3
  - status: running
    zone: obcluster-1-zone4
  - status: running
    zone: obcluster-1-zone5
  parameters: []
  status: running
```
