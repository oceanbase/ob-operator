# Delete zones from a cluster

This topic describes how to delete zones from a cluster.

## Prerequisites

Before you delete a zone from a cluster, make sure that the following conditions are met:

* The OceanBase cluster is in the `Running` state.
* After the zone is deleted, the available zones must be the majority.

## Procedure

Assume that the current cluster has five zones, `zone1`, `zone2`, `zone3`, `zone4`, and `zone5`, and each zone contains one OBServer node. You can perform the following steps to scale in the cluster to three zones.

1. Modify the `spec.topology` parameter in the `obcluster.yaml` configuration file to delete zone4 and zone5. For more information about the complete configuration file, see [Create a cluster](../200.create-cluster.md).

   ```yaml
   # For example, the OceanBase cluster has five zones.
   topology:
       - zone: zone1
       replica: 1
       - zone: zone2
       replica: 1
       - zone: zone3
       replica: 1
       - zone: zone4
       replica: 1
       - zone: zone5
       replica: 1

   # Delete zone4 and zone5 from the cluster.
   topology:
       - zone: zone1
       replica: 1
       - zone: zone2
       replica: 1
       - zone: zone3
       replica: 1

   ```

2. Run the following command for the modification to take effect:

   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f obcluster.yaml
   ```

3. Query the status of custom resources in the OceanBase cluster to check whether the operation succeeds.

Run the following command to query the status of custom resources in the OceanBase cluster. If the cluster and the three zones are in the `Running` state, the operation is successful.

```shell
kubectl get obclusters.oceanbase.oceanbase.com test -n oceanbase -o yaml

# desired output, only displays status here
status:
  image: oceanbase/oceanbase-cloud-native:4.2.0.0-101000032023091319
  obzones:
  - status: running
    zone: obcluster-1-zone1
  - status: running
    zone: obcluster-1-zone2
  - status: running
    zone: obcluster-1-zone3
  parameters: []
  status: running
```
