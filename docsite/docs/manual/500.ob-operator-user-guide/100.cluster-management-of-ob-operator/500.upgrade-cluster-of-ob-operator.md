# Upgrade a cluster

This topic describes how to upgrade an OceanBase cluster that is deployed by using ob-operator.

## Prerequisites

Before you upgrade a cluster, make sure that the cluster is in the `Running` state.

## Procedure

### Modify the tag setting in `spec`

1. Modify the configuration file of the OceanBase cluster. For more information about the complete configuration file, see [Create a cluster](200.create-cluster.md). Change the value of the `spec.observer.image` parameter to the target image.

   ```yaml
   # Before modification
   spec:
     observer:
       image: oceanbase/oceanbase-cloud-native:4.2.0.0-101000032023091319

   # After modification
   spec:
     observer:
       image: oceanbase/oceanbase-cloud-native:4.2.1.1-101000062023110109
   ```

2. Run the following command for the modification to take effect:

   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f obcluster.yaml
   ```

3. Query the status of custom resources in the OceanBase cluster to check whether the operation succeeds.
   Run the following command to query the status of custom resources in the OceanBase cluster. If the cluster is in the `Running` state and the value of the `image` parameter is the target image, the cluster is upgraded.

```shell
kubectl get obclusters.oceanbase.oceanbase.com test -n oceanbase -o yaml

# desired output, only displays status here
status:
  image: oceanbase/oceanbase-cloud-native:4.2.1.1-101000062023110109
  obzones:
  - status: running
    zone: obcluster-1-zone1
  - status: running
    zone: obcluster-1-zone2
  - status: running
    zone: obcluster-1-zone3
  parameters: []
  status: running
```
