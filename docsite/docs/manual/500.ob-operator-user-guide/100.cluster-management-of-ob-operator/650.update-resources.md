# Update resources

After the cluster is created and running, we may need to adjust the resource configuration of the OBServer node, such as CPU, memory, and storage volumes. This article introduces the resource configuration that can be modified and the specific operations.

## Scale up: Modify CPU and memory resources

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>Only the <code>standalone</code> mode cluster supports this operation.</p>
</main>

Assuming that we have created a single-node standalone cluster with a resource specification of 2C+10G. The configuration in YAML format is as follows:

```yaml
  observer:
    # ...
    resource:
      cpu: 2
      memory: 10Gi
    # ...
```

If you find that the resources are insufficient after running for a period of time and need to be expanded, you can directly modify this part of the configuration. For example, in the following YAML fragment, we have expanded the resource specification of the OBServer to 4C+16G.

```yaml
  observer:
    # ...
    resource:
      cpu: 4
      memory: 16Gi
    # ...
```

Upon modifying the YAML, apply it to the Kubernetes cluster. ob-operator will then perform the cluster's scale-up expansion. Once the OBCluster transitions back to a `running` state, the expansion is complete.

```shell
kubectl apply -f obcluster.yaml
kubectl get obcluster -w

NAME   STATUS             AGE
test   scale up obzone    xxx
test   scale up obzone    xxx
...
test   running            xxx
```

## Dynamically expand PVC

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>This operation requires that the storage class used by the cluster supports the <code>AllowVolumeExpansion</code> feature.</p>
</main>

Assuming that we have deployed an OBCluster, the storage configuration is shown in the following YAML fragment:

```yaml
  observer:
    # ...
    storage:
      dataStorage:
        storageClass: my-storage
        size: 50Gi
      redoLogStorage:
        storageClass: my-storage
        size: 50Gi
      logStorage:
        storageClass: my-storage
        size: 20Gi
    # ...
```

To expand the mounted volume, increase the `size` value in the YAML fragment and apply the changes via kubectl. ob-operator will handle the PVC expansion. Note that `size` can only be increased.

After modification, the configuration is as follows:

```yaml
  observer:
    # ...
    storage:
      dataStorage:
        storageClass: my-storage
        size: 60Gi
      redoLogStorage:
        storageClass: my-storage
        size: 60Gi
      logStorage:
        storageClass: my-storage
        size: 30Gi
    # ...
```

```shell
kubectl apply -f obcluster.yaml
kubectl get obcluster -w

NAME   STATUS             AGE
test   expand pvc         xxx
test   expand pvc         xxx
...
test   running            xxx
```
