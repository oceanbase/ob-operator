# Quick start

This topic describes how to deploy ob-operator and an OceanBase cluster and use ob-operator to manage OceanBase Database.

## Prerequisites

Before you start the deployment, make sure that the following conditions are met:

- You have an available Kubernetes cluster, which has at least 2 CPU cores, 10 GB of memory, and 100 GB of storage space.
- You have installed cert-manager. For more information about how to install cert-manager, see the [installation document](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/).
- You have installed local-path-provisioner and confirmed that the specified destination has sufficient storage space. For more information about how to install local-path-provisioner, see the documentation on [GitHub](https://github.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner).

## Deploy ob-operator

Run the following command to deploy ob-operator in the Kubernetes cluster:

- Deploy the stable version of ob-operator

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oceanbase/ob-operator/2.3.0_release/deploy/operator.yaml
   ```

- Deploy the developing version of ob-operator

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oceanbase/ob-operator/master/deploy/operator.yaml
   ```

Run the following command to verify that ob-operator is deployed:

```shell
kubectl get pod -n oceanbase-system
```

The expected output is as follows:

```shell
NAME                                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
oceanbase-controller-manager-86cfc8f7bf-4hfnj   2/2     Running   0          1m
```

## Deploy an OceanBase cluster

Perform the following steps to deploy an OceanBase cluster in the Kubernetes cluster:

1. Create secrets
   Before you create an OceanBase cluster, you must create secrets required for specific users. Run the following commands to create secrets:

   ```shell
   kubectl create secret generic root-password --from-literal=password='root_password'
   kubectl create secret generic proxyro-password --from-literal=password='proxyro_password'
   kubectl create secret generic monitor-password --from-literal=password='monitor_password'
   kubectl create secret generic operator-password --from-literal=password='operator_password'
   ```

2. Deploy an OceanBase cluster
   Run the following command to deploy an OceanBase cluster in the Kubernetes cluster:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oceanbase/ob-operator/2.3.0_release/example/quickstart/obcluster.yaml
   ```

   In general, it takes about 2 minutes to create a cluster. Run the following command to check the cluster status:

   ```shell
   kubectl get obclusters.oceanbase.oceanbase.com test
   ```

   The expected output is as follows:

   ```shell
   NAME   STATUS    AGE
   test   running   6m2s
   ```

3. Connect to the OceanBase cluster
   Perform the following steps to connect to the created OceanBase cluster:

   ```shell
   # Run the following command to obtain the IP address and name of the pod for the server where the OceanBase cluster is deployed.
   # The pod name is in the {cluster_name}-{cluster_id}-{zone}-uuid format.
   kubectl get pods -o wide
   # Run the following command to connect to the cluster.
   mysql -h{POD_IP} -P2881 -uroot -p'root_password' oceanbase -A -c
   ```

## What to do next

This topic describes how to deploy ob-operator and an OceanBase cluster. You can use the method to quickly set up the environment. For more information about the deployment and O&M of clusters in a production environment, see [Manage clusters](500.ob-operator-user-guide/100.cluster-management-of-ob-operator/100.cluster-management-intro.md).

After you create a cluster, you need to create a business tenant. For more information about tenant management, see [Manage OceanBase Database tenants](500.ob-operator-user-guide/200.tenant-management-of-ob-operator/000.tenant-management-intro.md).
