                                          incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `LabelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                          to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                          for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                          pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                          The same key is forbidden to exist in both MismatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.
                                          Also, MismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.
                                          This is an alpha field and requires enabling MatchLabelKeysInPodAffinity feature gate.

                              ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                              The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                              and deleted when the pod is removed.


                              Use this if:
                              a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                              b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                 tracking are needed,
                              c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                              d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                 a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                 information on the connection between this volume type
                                 and PersistentVolumeClaim).


                              Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                              APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                              of an individual pod.


                              Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                              be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                              more information.


                              A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                              persistent volumes at the same time.
                            properties:

                                  Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                  The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                  owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                  pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                  `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                  entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                  is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).


                                  An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                  will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                  volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                  the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                  meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                  owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                  this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                  manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                  to the PVC after it has been created.

                                          dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                          volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                          core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                          When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                          the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                          provisioner.
                                          This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                          if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                          compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                          both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                          value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                          When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                          dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                          There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                          * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                            allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                          * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                            preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                            specified.
                                          * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                            in any namespaces.
                                          (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                          (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                description: |-
                                  ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                  The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                  and deleted when the pod is removed.


                                  Use this if:
                                  a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                  b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                     tracking are needed,
                                  c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                  d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                     a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                     information on the connection between this volume type
                                     and PersistentVolumeClaim).


                                  Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                  APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                  of an individual pod.


                                  Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                  be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                  more information.


                                  A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                  persistent volumes at the same time.
                                properties:
                                  volumeClaimTemplate:
                                    description: |-
                                      Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                      The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                      owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                      pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                      `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                      entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                      is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).


                                      An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                      will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                      volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                      the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                      meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                      owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                      this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when

                                              dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                              volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                              core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                              When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                              the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                              provisioner.
                                              This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                              if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                              compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                              both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                              value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                              When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                              dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                              There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                              * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                                allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                              * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                                preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                                specified.
                                              * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                                in any namespaces.
                                              (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                              (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                              If the resource referred to by volumeAttributesClass does not exist, this PersistentVolumeClaim will be

                        description: |-
                          ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                          The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                          and deleted when the pod is removed.


                          Use this if:
                          a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                          b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                             tracking are needed,
                          c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                          d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                             a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                             information on the connection between this volume type
                             and PersistentVolumeClaim).


                          Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                          APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                          of an individual pod.


                          Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                          be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                          more information.


                          A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                          persistent volumes at the same time.

                              Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                              The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                              owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                              pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                              `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                              entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                              is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).


                              An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                              will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                              volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                              the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                              meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                              owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                              this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                              manually reconstructing a broken cluster.


                              This field is read-only and no changes will be made by Kubernetes
                              to the PVC after it has been created.

                                      dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                      volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                      core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                      When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                      the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                      provisioner.
                                      This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                      if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                      compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                      both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                      value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                      When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                      dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                      There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                      * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                        allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                      * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                        preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                        specified.
                                      * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                        in any namespaces.
                                      (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                      (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                              Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.
                              Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                              tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                              of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default,
                              it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                              negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                        description: |-
                          ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                          The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                          and deleted when the pod is removed.


                          Use this if:
                          a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                          b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                             tracking are needed,
                          c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                          d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                             a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                             information on the connection between this volume type
                             and PersistentVolumeClaim).


                          Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                          APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                          of an individual pod.


                          Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                          be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                          more information.


                          A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                          persistent volumes at the same time.

                              Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                              The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                              owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                              pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                              `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                              entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                              is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).


                              An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                              will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                              volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                              the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                              meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                              owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                              this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                              manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                      There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                      * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                        allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                      * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                        preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                        specified.
                                      * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                        in any namespaces.
                                      (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                      (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                        Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects.
                        When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.

                        Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys.
                        If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.

                    operator:
                      description: |-
                        Operator represents a key's relationship to the value.
                        Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.
                        Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                        tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                        TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be
                        of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default,
                        it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                        negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                        description: |-
                          ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                          The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                          and deleted when the pod is removed.


                          Use this if:
                          a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                          b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                             tracking are needed,
                          c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                          d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                             a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                             information on the connection between this volume type
                             and PersistentVolumeClaim).


                          Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                          APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                          of an individual pod.


                          Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                          be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                          more information.


                          A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                          persistent volumes at the same time.

                              Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                              The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                              owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                              pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                              `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                              entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                              is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).


                              An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                              will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                              volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                              the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                              meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                              owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                              this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                              manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                              to the PVC after it has been created.

                                      value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                      When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                      dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                      There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                      * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                        allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                      * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                        preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                        specified.
                                      * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                        in any namespaces.
                                      (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                      (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                        The pod this Toleration is attached to tolerates any taint that matches
                        the triple <key,value,effect> using the matching operator <operator>.

                        effect:
                          description: |-
                            Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects.
                            When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.

                        key:
                          description: |-
                            Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys.
                            If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.
                          type: string
                        operator:
                          description: |-
                            Operator represents a key's relationship to the value.
                            Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.
                            Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                            tolerate all taints of a particular category.
                          type: string
                        tolerationSeconds:
                          description: |-
                            TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be
                            of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default,
                            it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                            negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                          description: |-
                            Value is the taint value the toleration matches to.
                            If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.
